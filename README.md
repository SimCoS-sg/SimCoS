# Appendix
Table 1 presents the generated stories in OutGen from $\text{LongLM}_{\text{base}}$ and SimCoS. $\text{LongLM}_{\text{base}}$ incorporating multiple phrases struggles with logical consistency and verbosity, often repeating themes of solitude. In contrast, SimCoS utilizes a greater number of phrases more effectively, creating a coherent and logically structured narrative that included a variety of elements such as the blooming process, human interactions, and a final ending.
